### Parallax Effect

Parallax effect done in css.

Done as instructed in the youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQ7DYni7Bg) by channel Codegrid.

##### Notes
1. Code works well in chrome, but, not in firefox. In firefox, scrolling is severely limited.
2. Font "Luna" used in the tutorial was not available on my system, so, used google font "Kaushan Script". It seems close enough.
3. It's not clear how to add content below the header. I added a \<p\> and a \<div\>, it doesn't show.
4. Some css is redundant, so, has been commented out.
5. Adding "overflow-x: hidden" to html style prevented horizontal mouse scrolling in firefox, but, not in chrome.
